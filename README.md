# Subjective Answer Evaluation using Machine Learning
This repository contains the project "Subjective Answer Evaluation using Machine Learning," which was developed using Python, TensorFlow, NLP, and Django. The project focuses on designing a platform for conducting online tests and utilizing advanced language models to evaluate students' answers objectively.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Online Test Platform:** A robust online test platform was designed using the Django framework. This platform provides a user-friendly interface for conducting subjective tests and collecting students' answers.

2. **Answer Evaluation:** To score students' answers objectively, advanced language models were implemented. The project utilized state-of-the-art models like BERT, USE, and Word2Vec to compare the semantic similarity between students' answers and the teacher's answer.

## Technology Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Django
